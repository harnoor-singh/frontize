Hello, frontizers!

I am Avish Kathpal, a developer with almost no real experience, starting a big project named frontize, an application to take the pain out of front of the front-end.

It will be a simple app, to help build frontends easily, so that developers can spend more time on code quality and performance.

This blog is just a weekly log of what decisions were made and the reasoning behind that. Also, I am bad at web designing so I wanted to do this as a side project to learn.

Anyway, I guess this is enough for the intro. Be sure to check out the weekly post if you want to follow the development process.

Thank you for reading!
