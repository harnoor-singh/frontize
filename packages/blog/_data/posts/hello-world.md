Welcome to the frontize blog.

This blog serves as a weekly log of the development process of [frontize](https://www.github.com/AvKat/frontize.git), thus covering the progress, the major decisions taken throughout the week, the reasoning behind them and the future of the application.

Anyway, I guess this is enough for the intro. Be sure to check out the weekly post if you want to follow the development process.

Thank you for reading!
